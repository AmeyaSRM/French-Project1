        <h1>National Cuisine</h1>
    </header>
    <p>French national cuisine is renowned for its structured approach to dining, typically consisting of multiple courses that showcase the richness and variety of French culinary traditions. Here's an overview of the typical three-course meal in French dining:</p>
    <h2>Hors d'œuvre or Entrée</h2>
    <p>The meal often begins with an hors d'œuvre (literally "outside the work"), which serves as an introductory course to tantalize the palate and stimulate the appetite. This course can include a variety of small dishes such as salads, terrines, pâtés, soups, or seafood appetizers. In some cases, the hors d'œuvre may be skipped, especially if a soup is served as the first course.</p>
    <h2>Plat Principal</h2>
    <p>The main course, known as the plat principal, is the centerpiece of the meal and typically features a substantial portion of protein, such as meat, poultry, fish, or vegetarian options like quiche or vegetable gratin. The plat principal is often accompanied by a variety of side dishes, including vegetables, starches (such as potatoes or rice), and sauces that complement and enhance the flavors of the main ingredient. This course represents the heart of the meal and reflects the skill and creativity of the chef in preparing and presenting a balanced and satisfying dish.</p>
    <h2>Fromage (Cheese Course) or Dessert</h2>
    <p>Following the main course, diners may have the option to enjoy a cheese course, known as the fromage, featuring a selection of fine French cheeses served with bread, crackers, or fruit. Alternatively, the meal may conclude with dessert, which can range from classic French pastries, cakes, and tarts to custards, puddings, and sorbets. Dessert is often accompanied by coffee or tea, providing a sweet and satisfying conclusion to the dining experience. Additionally, it's common for a salad course to be offered either before the cheese or dessert, serving as a refreshing palate cleanser and providing a light and healthy accompaniment to the meal.</p>
