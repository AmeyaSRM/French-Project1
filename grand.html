  <h1 align="center"> Grand Est</h1>
 </header><br><br>
 <aside class="mo">
   <p> Bordering Germany (and historically sometimes annexed by Germany), the Grand Est was formed from the regions Alsace, Lorraine and Champagne-Ardenne. While the main attraction for many is tasting champagne from Champagne, Grand Est is known for its postcard-pretty German influenced villages, fairytale castles like Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg, and vast national parks. The capital of the region is Strasbourg, famous for its grand cathedral and lively Christmas markets. Grand Est is a notable wine region, while German-style food specialities include stewed potatoes, choucroute, pork sausages and the one and only quiche Lorraine 
    
    <h2 align="center">Choucroute Garnie</h2>
    
    Choucroute garnie (sauerkraut) is one of the most famous dishes from the Grand Est region, making good use of the region’s love for meat to bring this dish alive, as well as a strong German influence. The sausage used is typically Morteau, Montbéliard or Strasbourg sausages. The cabbage is cooked with riesling and onion, and served with potatoes and pork or bacon.
    <div class="bgi1 "> <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <p>
   <ul>
<li>1/3 cup kosher salt, plus more for seasoning</li>

<li> 2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>

<li>3 pounds pork back ribs or baby back ribs, cut into 3 sections</li>

<li>6 pounds sauerkraut (in plastic bags), drained</li>

<li>1/4 cup duck or goose fat, or peanut oil</li>

<li>1 large onion, coarsely chopped</li>

<li>4 large garlic cloves, coarsely chopped</li>

<li>20 juniper berries</li>

<li>3 large bay leaves</li>

<li>1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds</li>

<li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

<li>3 cups chicken stock</li>

<li>1.5cups Riesling or Pinot Gris</li>

<li>2 pounds Polish kielbasa, skinned and cut into 2-inch pieces</li>

<li>10 skinless hot dogs</li>

<li>1 (2-pound) piece of boneless boiled ham (3 to 4 inches wide), sliced 1/4-inch thick</li>

<li>2 pounds medium potatoes (about 10), peeled</li>

<li>Assorted mustards, for serving</ul></p></div>

<nav>
<h4 align="center" class="new">Method</h4>
<h5>STEP 1</h5>In a large, sturdy, resealable plastic bag, combine the 1/3 cup of kosher salt with the sugar. Add the pork ribs; shake well to thoroughly coat the ribs with the seasonings. Seal the bag and refrigerate the ribs overnight or for up to 24 hours.

<h5>STEP 2</h5>The next day, preheat the oven to 300°F. Rinse the sauerkraut in cold water and squeeze dry. Set a large roasting pan over two burners on high heat and melt the duck fat. Add the onion and garlic and cook over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened, about 7 minutes. Stir in the sauerkraut, juniper berries, bay leaves, caraway seeds, black pepper, stock, and wine; bring to a rolling boil over high heat.

<h5>STEP 3</h5>Meanwhile, rinse the pork ribs under cold water and pat dry. Nestle the pork ribs in the sauerkraut and bring back to a boil over moderately high heat. Cover tightly with foil and bake for 1.5 hours.

<h5>STEP 4</h5>Remove the pork ribs from the sauerkraut. Cut down in between the ribs. Return the ribs to the sauerkraut and nestle in the kielbasa, hot dogs, and ham. Cover and bake until the meats are hot, about 25 minutes. Discard the bay leaves.

<h5>STEP 5</h5>Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, cover the potatoes with cold water, add salt, and bring to a boil over high heat; cook the potatoes until tender when pierced. Drain the potatoes and cover to keep warm.

<h5>STEP 6 </h5>To serve, mound the hot sauerkraut in the center of very hot dinner plates and partially tuck in the pork ribs and the kielbasa. Arrange the hot dogs and ham around the sauerkraut. Alternatively, pile the sauerkraut on a large heated platter and garnish with the meats. Serve the choucroute with the boiled potatoes and assorted mustards.

 <div class="bgi3">
    <aside class="a2">
    A baeckeoffe (meaning baker’s oven) is a traditional Alsatian casserole dish of beef, pork, lamb, onion, leek, potato, and white wine. Pork trotter is also sometimes added to the mixture. Traditionally, the casserole would be taken to the local baker, who would seal the dish with a pastry crust, and cook them in the oven. These days, it’s much easier to bake one at home!</aside>
    <h4 class="ameya1">Ingredients</h4>
    <aside class="ab16">
    <ul>
<li> 1 lb pork shoulder</li>
<li> 1 lb beef shoulder or stewing beef</li>
<li>1 lb lamb shoulder</li>
<li>Salt/pepper to taste</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>

</ul> </p>
</div>
</aside>
<nav class="mo">
<h4 align="center" class="ameya1">METHOD</h4>

<h5 >STEP 1</h5>

Cut the meat into bite-sized cubes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and place meat in a large bowl. Add the garlic cloves, sliced onion, thyme, and two bay leaves. Add the dry white wine to the bowl- enough to cover the ingredients. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let ingredients marinate in the fridge for at least six hours (preferably 12 hours).

<h5>STEP 2</h5>
Remove bowl from the fridge and strain the liquid from the other ingredients, reserving the liquid for later. Peel the potatoes and slice into thin round pieces. To prepare the leeks, slice the white part into thin circles. Brush the bottom of a large casserole dish with oil, then add one half of the potato slices on the bottom. Add the meat mixture (including the onions and garlic), followed by the chopped carrots, leeks, parsley, and cornstarch.

<h5>STEP 3</h5>
Slice the bacon into 1-inch cubes and lightly cook on the stovetop for several minutes (careful not to over-cook the bacon). Add the bacon to the casserole dish, followed by the remaining potato slices. Pour in the marinade until the ingredients are covered; if necessary, add more wine or water to ensure the ingredients are fully covered.

<h5>STEP 4</h5>
Bake in a pre-heated oven at 350 F for at least 2 ½ hours or longer, until the meat is very soft and shreds easily. Serve hot.

<h2 align="center"> Quiche Lorraine</h2>
    While quiche Lorraine is often thought of as one of France’s quintessential dishes, it actually originated in 12th century German state, Lotharingia (Lotharingie). Today, the French portion of Lotharingia is named Lorraine, after many border changes and annexations throughout history. The quiche Lorraine is the most famous in the wide variety of quiches available, made with eggs and milk (or cream), and lardons, baked in a pie crust.
    <h4 class="ab16">Ingredients</h4>
    For the pastry:
    <ul>
     <li>75g plain flour</li>
     <li> 100g cold butter, cut into pieces</li>
     <li> 1 egg yolk</li></ul>
     For the filling:
    <ul>
        <li>200g pack lardons, unsmoked or smoked</li>
        <li> 50g gruyère</li>
        <li> 200ml carton crème fraîche</li>
        <li> 200ml double cream</li>
        <li>3 eggs, well beaten</li>
        <li>pinch ground nutmeg</ul></p></aside>
           <nav>
            <h4 align="center" class="new">METHOD</h4>
<h5>STEP 1</h5>
For the pastry, put 175g plain flour, 100g cold butter, cut into pieces, 1 egg yolk and 4 tsp cold water into a food processor. Using the pulse button, process until the mix binds.

<h5>STEP 2</h5>
Tip the pastry onto a lightly floured surface, gather into a smooth ball, then roll out as thinly as you can.

<h5>STEP 3</h5>
Line a 23 x 2.5cm loose-bottomed, fluted flan tin, easing the pastry into the base.
<h5>STEP 4</h5>
Trim the pastry edges with scissors (save any trimmings) so it sits slightly above the tin (if it shrinks, it shouldn’t now go below the level of the tin). Press the pastry into the flutes, lightly prick the base with a fork, then chill for 10 mins.

<h5>STEP 5</h5>
Put a baking sheet in the oven and heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Line pastry case with foil, shiny side down, fill with dry beans and bake on the hot sheet for 15 mins.

<h5>STEP 6</h5>

Remove foil and beans and bake for 4-5 mins more until the pastry is pale golden. If you notice any small holes or cracks, patch up with pastry trimmings. You can make up to this point a day ahead.

<h5>STEP 7</h5>
While the pastry cooks, prepare the filling. Heat a small frying pan, tip in 200g lardons and fry for a couple of mins. Drain off any liquid that comes out, then continue cooking until the lardons just start to colour, but aren’t crisp. Remove and drain on paper towels.

<h5>STEP 8</h5>
Cut three quarters of the 50g gruyère into small dice and finely grate the rest. Scatter the diced gruyère and fried lardons over the bottom of the pastry case.

<h5>STEP 9</h5>
Using a spoon, beat 200ml crème fraîche to slacken it then slowly beat in 200ml double cream. Mix in 3 well beaten eggs. Season (you shouldn’t need much salt) and add a pinch of ground nutmeg. Pour three quarters of the filling into the pastry case.

<h5>STEP 10</h5>
Half-pull the oven shelf out and put the flan tin on the baking sheet. Quickly pour the rest of the filling into the pastry case – you get it right to the top this way. Scatter the grated cheese over the top, then carefully push the shelf back into the oven.

<h5>STEP 11</h5>
Lower the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Bake for about 25 mins, or until golden and softly set (the centre should not feel too firm).

<h5>STEP 12</h5>
Let the quiche settle for 4-5 mins, then remove from the tin. Serve freshly baked, although it’s also good cold.

<h2 align="center"> Quiche Lorraine</h2>

    <aside class="2a2">


     
        While quiche Lorraine is often thought of as one of France’s quintessential dishes, it actually originated in 12th century German state, Lotharingia (Lotharingie). Today, the French portion of Lotharingia is named Lorraine, after many border changes and annexations throughout history. The quiche Lorraine is the most famous in the wide variety of quiches available, made with eggs and milk (or cream), and lardons, baked in a pie crust.</aside>

        <aside class="a2">
            
<h5>STEP 1</h5>
For the pastry, put 175g plain flour, 100g cold butter, cut into pieces, 1 egg yolk and 4 tsp cold water into a food processor. Using the pulse button, process until the mix binds.

<h5>STEP 2</h5>
Tip the pastry onto a lightly floured surface, gather into a smooth ball, then roll out as thinly as you can.

<h5>STEP 3</h5>
Line a 23 x 2.5cm loose-bottomed, fluted flan tin, easing the pastry into the base.
<h5>STEP 4</h5>
Trim the pastry edges with scissors (save any trimmings) so it sits slightly above the tin (if it shrinks, it shouldn’t now go below the level of the tin). Press the pastry into the flutes, lightly prick the base with a fork, then chill for 10 mins.

<h5>STEP 5</h5>
Put a baking sheet in the oven and heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Line pastry case with foil, shiny side down, fill with dry beans and bake on the hot sheet for 15 mins.

<h5>STEP 6</h5>

Remove foil and beans and bake for 4-5 mins more until the pastry is pale golden. If you notice any small holes or cracks, patch up with pastry trimmings. You can make up to this point a day ahead.

<h5>STEP 7</h5>
While the pastry cooks, prepare the filling. Heat a small frying pan, tip in 200g lardons and fry for a couple of mins. Drain off any liquid that comes out, then continue cooking until the lardons just start to colour, but aren’t crisp. Remove and drain on paper towels.

<h5>STEP 8</h5>
Cut three quarters of the 50g gruyère into small dice and finely grate the rest. Scatter the diced gruyère and fried lardons over the bottom of the pastry case.
